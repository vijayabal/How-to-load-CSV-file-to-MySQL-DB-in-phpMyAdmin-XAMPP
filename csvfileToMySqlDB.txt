		create table => create table pinnumber(
									-> villageName varchar(200),
									-> officeName varchar(200),

									-> subdistname varchar(200),
									-> distName varchar(200),

												Records: 906267  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 2074							

More terminate option in csv file:
												
fields terminated by – this is why I included step 2. I thought a csv would default to comma separated but at least in my case semicolon was the deafult

enclosed by – my data was not enclosed by anything so I left this as empty string ”

lines terminated by – at first I tried with only ‘\n’ but had to add the ‘\r’ to get rid of a carriage return character being imported into the database
